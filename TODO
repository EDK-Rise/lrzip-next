MAYBE TODO for lrzip program

Make sure STDIO works properly on large files on apple.

Other posix/windows builds?? Need help there...

Add log file option so that output could be
saved for review.

Add test function that would only run lzo_compresses
for a current file without doing any writes.

Consider ncurses version or even GUI one.

Consider using LZMA Filters for processor-optimised
coding to increase compression.
- x86 filter added 12/2019

Consider using LZMA2 which is recommended for programs
that integrates LZMA in streams.
(PAH, since lzma properties would only be 2 bytes, and
it uses lzma anyway, its benefit is in question)

Use Multi-Threading LZMA Decoder.

Try and convert MASM style Assembler for ASM LZMA
Decoding which is supposed to be 30% faster.

Update Threading and atomic use for semaphores and
atomic memory access using GCC.

ZPAQ progress does not show progress in 7.15. show_progress
function not called properly on compression.

See if ram management can be improved. Specifically
to check Available RAM, not just Total RAM. Needed
for low ram systems without swap.
