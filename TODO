TODO for lrzip-next program

ZPAQ progress does not show progress in 7.15. show_progress
function not called properly on compression.

See if ram management can be improved. Specifically
to check Available RAM, not just Total RAM. Needed
for low ram systems without swap.

Use git describe to manage version numbers, not hard code in
configure.ac

Figure out why swapfile is used on larger compressions.
If swap is off, compression still runs fine.

Update documentation for new Hash and Encryption options.
