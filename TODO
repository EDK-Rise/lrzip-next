MAYBE TODO for lrzip program

Make sure STDIO works properly on large files on apple.

Other posix/windows builds?? Need help there...

Add log file option so that output could be
saved for review.

Add test function that would only run lzo_compresses
for a current file without doing any writes.

ZPAQ progress does not show progress in 7.15. show_progress
function not called properly on compression.

See if ram management can be improved. Specifically
to check Available RAM, not just Total RAM. Needed
for low ram systems without swap.

Use git describe to manage version numbers, not hard code in
configure.ac
