Attempt to set Dictionary Size from commandline. Problem is
that setup_overhead() is called before filesize is known.
Need to determine file size to make sure Dictionary is not
too large. Similar to reduce_size variable in LzmaEnc.
So right now, dictSize is not set and remains zero as is
the current default.
