Decided to get rid of LZMA default = 5 and scrap the below idea.

January 2020

With default LZMA level now 5, hashing levels are affected.
Saving this code for future reference.

	// Adjusting lzma default level to 5 changes hashing success
	// We readjust here and expand hashing for lower levels
	if (LZMA_COMPRESS) {
		switch(control->compression_level) {
			case 1:
			case 2:
			case 3:
			case 4: st->level = &levels[6];
				break;
			case 5:
			case 6:
			case 7: st->level = &levels[7];
				break;
			default: break;
		}
	}

While increased hashing level does make rzip more effective,
it makes lzma less so. Results are about the same with higher
rzip and overall compression is impacted very little. The
above code also makes lrzip a little slower.

In lrzip 0.631
lzma Level = level * 7/9. rzip level = level
In lrzip 0.702
lzma Level = level (default 5), rzip level = level

Consider not adjusting lzma default to 5 and just leave default
at 7.
