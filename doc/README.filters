lrzip 0.70

This version has implemented the use of filters. These filters
are executed just prior to compression and just after
decompression. They include:

- x86. Branch, call, jump (BCJ) conversion for x86 code.
- arm. "" for ARM code.
- armt. "" for ARMT code.
- ppc. "" for PPC code.
- sparc. "" for SPARC code.
- ia64. "" for IA64 code.
- delta. delta offset conversion. Default is 1.

Filters are only applied to literal values after rzip
compression. Their impact is not possible to predict and
could result in larger compressed files than non-filtered.
Delta compression is best for media files, such as
uncompressed audio. WAV and PCM files show good results.

Delta Filters --delta parameter has an optional argument
of 1-32. The offset is applied as follows:

1-17 is offset as entered. (Default is 1 if no argument)
18-32 is applied as (offset-16) * 16.

Delta offset values will be:
1..17,32,48,64,80,96,112,128,144,160,176.192.208,224,240, and
256.

When written to magic, the delta offset parameter is written as 0
to 31.

Truthfully, offset 1 is all that is needed. Anything else that
may provide results will be happenstance!
